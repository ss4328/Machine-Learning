# Shiv Suhane - My exploration of AI/Machine Learning

## About
This directory contains nearly all the coding/notes prepared in the most relevant sections. Each directory has it's associated notes, which are also separately collected in 'aggregated notes' directory. 


## Missing bits
- PCA Notes
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Ensemble Learning
- KNN algorithm Notes

I'll try to add them if I find the time/energy.


## Special Note
If you're a drexel student currently taking the course, feel free to just view the notes. The separate directory 'aggregated notes' is made for you. Don't copy the code as this could constitute to plagiarism.

Still persistent? 
Go through this rather funny git repo of a student caught plagiarising.

His punishment was to make a repo of "how to cheat in CS". This is his conclusion:

Cheating requires just as much effort as genuinely doing the work. Modifying a assignment to make your own is just as much hard work as doing it yourself. Except when you do it yourself you actually learn.

My advice: If you actually put the effort, CS383 is a rewarding course. If you're stuck with maths, read the math review slides and reach out. If you still can't code for crap, take Andrew NG's coursera course, it'll surely help out. Don't cheat, I've seen students get caught and it isn't pretty.
