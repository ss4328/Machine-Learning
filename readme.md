# An Open Exploration of Artificial intelligence

## About
This is a repository that I've created to track my progress in AI/Data Science related topics in order to organise and share encountered information and knowledge. The goal of this repo is to organize/retrieve my ML/AI work, and to share the study material for others in the same boat.

## AI Programming Showcase
In this section I want to showcase the accumulated information about various Machine learning and deep algorithms, used libraries and more. The Priority here is to show how the algorithm works - not to solve complex and ambitious problems, usually on classical or generated datasets. I'll try to make updates to the readme in chronological order so that any explorer is able to sequentially decipher the implementation.

### Raw Python

#### Machine Learning
| Algorithm  | Description | Implementation | Dataset 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
| Dimentionality reduction - PCA | Dimentional reduction of 154 images | Python/Matlab | Yalefaces | 18.04.2017 
| k-Means Clustering | Compared result with Linear Regression |  Python/Matlab  | Pima-Indians Diabetes Dataset 
| Linear Regression | Predicting the length of fish| Python | Fish-length Dataset
| Logistic Regression | Gradient descent with sigmoid - predict spam/non-spam  | Python | Spabase dataset
| Naive Bayes | Classifying spam/non-spam | Python  | Spabase dataset

## Motivation
I initially began my exploration into AI by taking the Machine learning class at my University where I'm pursuing my undergrad degree. In the beginning, I was somewhat daunted by the mathematics in course. I ended up doing pretty bad on my first assignment but I figured I was wasting my energy on the wrong component: Matlab. So far, I had no prior experience in Matlab and frankly hated evey last bit of it. I moved to python (with Spyder IDE; choice doesn't matter though) and then everything got easier as I've had experience working with python. Then I made myself familiar with the linear algebra used so heavily in ML; here, Khan Academy was a huge help. I then took organized notes for each encountered algorithm and frequently reviewed them (Look at agregated notes). After the course ended, I kinda-discovered this is cool stuff and I'd definitely like to learn more. 

Philly went on lockdown due in March due to COVID-19 and so, I had a bunch of time on my hands. So, I started  the Coursera Deep learning specialization online, hoping to make the best use of my time (let's see).

## Tips:
1. Watch the coursera videos at 1.25x. I feel it's too slow.
2. Aggregated Notes were prepared by using a Rocketbook. I highly recommend getting one.
