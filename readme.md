# Shiv Suhane - My exploration of AI

## About
This is a repository that I've created to track my progress in AI/Data Science related topics in order to organise my knowledge and goals. I've created this repository to organize/retrieve my ML/AI work, and to create study material for others in the same boat.

## AI Programming Showcase
In this section I want to showcase my knowledge about various AI related algorithms, frameworks, programming languages, libraries and more. Priority is to show how the algorithm works - not to solve complex and ambitious problems. Usually on classical or generated datasets. I'll try to make updates to the readme in chronological order so that any explorer is able to see the path I took.

### Raw Python

#### Machine Learning
| Algorithm  | Description | Implementation | Dataset 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
| Dimentionality reduction - PCA | Dimentional reduction of 154 images | Python/Matlab | Yalefaces | 18.04.2017 
| k-Means Clustering | Compared result with Linear Regression |  Python/Matlab  | Pima-Indians Diabetes Dataset 
| Linear Regression | Predicting the length of fish| Python | Fish-length Dataset
| Logistic Regression | Gradient descent with sigmoid - predict spam/non-spam  | Python | Spabase dataset
| Naive Bayes | Classifying spam/non-spam | Python  | Spabase dataset

## Anecdotes
I initially began my exploration into AI by taking the Machine learning class at Drexel University where I'm pursuing my undergrad degree. I was initially daunted by the mathematics of the course and felt lost in the course. I ended up doing quite bad on my first assignment but I figured I was wasting my energy on the wrong component: Matlab, in which I had no experience and frankly hated evey last bit of it. I moved to python (with Spyder IDE; choice doesn't matter though) and then everything got easier. Then I made a goal to get familiar with the linear algebra used so heavily in ML, khan academy was a huge help in this front. I started putting consistent effort, and gradually started improving to ended up with a pretty okay-ish grade in the course. Well, I also kinda-discovered this is cool stuff and I'd definitely like to learn more. 

Well, philly went on lockdown due to COVID-19 and I had a bunch of time on my hands with mostly nothing to do. So, I started  the Coursera Deep learning specialization online, hoping to make the best use of my time.
